Diagnosing Alzheimerâ€™s disease from on-line handwriting: A novel dataset and performance benchmarking

1) DARWIN protocol
The protocol is comprised of 25 tasks, with different levels of complexity and targeting different areas of the brain. The handwriting/drawing movements performed to execute each task are then described by using 18 features. Our preliminary results on the dataset showed that different tasks complement each others in such a way that the combination of the information brought by the execution of each of them led to a multi-classifier achieving state-of-the-art performance (De Gregorio et al., 2021).
